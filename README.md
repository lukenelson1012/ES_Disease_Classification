# Eryhemato-Squamous Disease Classification

The disorders in the category of E-S Disease are psoriasis (1), seborrheic dermatitis (2), lichen planus (3), pityriasis rosea (4), chronic dermatitis (5), and pityriasis rubra pilaris (6).

Usually, a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis, but unfortunately, these diseases share many histopathological features as well (columns 12-33).

This project was created using a Kaggle dataset. The link to the dataset is linked below:
