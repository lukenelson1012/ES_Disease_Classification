# Eryhemato-Squamous Disease Classification

The disorders in the category of E-S Disease are psoriasis (1), seborrheic dermatitis (2), lichen planus (3), pityriasis rosea (4), chronic dermatitis (5), and pityriasis rubra pilaris (6).

Usually, a biopsy is necessary for the diagnosis, but unfortunately, these diseases share many histopathological features as well (columns 12-33).

Results: The model was able to predict with 95.83% accuracy

Further changes:
* Add more data to avoid model always classifying one class
* Structure project properly according to python conventions
* Automate certain portions of the process and split code into separate files for better reproducibility

This project was created using a Kaggle dataset. The link to the dataset is linked below:
